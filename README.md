<p>
    Hello there! 👋 My name is Pavel, I’m an Android developer with a strong foundation in creating mobile applications through personal projects. 
    At university, I studied full-stack development and gained hands-on experience by contributing to my university's React-based website.  
    I'm always exploring new technologies and looking to expand my skill set.  
    Beyond development, I enjoy music – singing, playing the piano, and the guitar. 🎶
